thsSort - a simple c++ sorting library i made for school projects

this library contains three main algorithms:
  - Median Of Sixteen Adaptive Quicksort (as "`sort`")
  - thatsOven's Adaptive MergeSort (as "`stableSort`")
  - featureSort (as "`featureSort`, please note it only works on numeric types)

alongside with secondary algorithms, used inside the main ones.
