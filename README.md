thsSort - a simple sorting library i made for school projects

this library contains three main algorithms:
  - Median Of Sixteen Adaptive Quicksort (as "`sort`")
  - thatsOven's Adaptive MergeSort (as "`stableSort`")
  - staticSort (as "`staticSort`", please note it only works on numeric types)

alongside with secondary algorithms, used inside the main ones.
